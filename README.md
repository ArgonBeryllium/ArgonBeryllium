Hi, I go by ArBe. Welcome to my GitHub.  

Be warned, a lot of the repos here are [game jam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_jam) games.
As such, due to both the time crunch and (higher than usual) amount of sleep deprivation inherent to their development, the quality of those projects is bound to be less than stellar.
That said, even when it comes to other projects(i.e. ones made under less pressure), I already cringe at code of mine that's not even a year old. I'm continuously learning.
